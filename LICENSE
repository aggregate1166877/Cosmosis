On a related note: this project is currently licensed MIT because it will one
day be stripped of game logic and be transformed into a game engine. The
Cosmosis engine itself will then be a dependency of the Cosmosis game. The
engine itself will be a core part of any game using it, meaning that anyone who
wants to protect their source would need a low restriction license such as MIT.
Once the engine code is separated and is a dependency of the game, the engine
will have an MIT license while the game will likely be licensed GPL. This is
not set in stone and you're free to voice opinions any part of this change. All
comment will be highly appreciated will directly influence all decisions going
forward. Note that this decision will not be made for some years.
