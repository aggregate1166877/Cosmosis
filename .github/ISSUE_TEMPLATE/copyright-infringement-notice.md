**Buying the asset from you**

REPLACE THE TEXT HERE WITH YOUR ANSWER
May we, the project owners, purchase the asset from you instead of removing it?

If you allow us to purchase the asset, the agreement will require explicit permission to modify the source work, and your name will be in the credits. This will be extended to any derivatives of the project, including but not limited to people who clone this project and rename it, commercially or otherwise.
