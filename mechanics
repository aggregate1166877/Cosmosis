Player combat
=============

Combat is souls like. Loadouts can be combined, and determine roll types. Loadouts are as follows:
* Hunter (bloodborne like, has rally)
* Hollow (souls like, has shields)
* Rifleman (fps like, has guns and limited ammo)

Choosing only one loadout will give you light rolling, subject to these conditions:
* Hollow shields and armour contribute to weight, and can make you medium or fat roll.
* Rifle ammo contribute to weight, and can make you medium or fat roll.

Hunter gear never contributes to roll weight in and of itself. Combining it with other loadout options will.

Some combination examples:
* Hunter only - light roll.
* Shield only, with light shield and armour - light roll.
* Guns only, with 50% ammo capacity - light roll.
* Hunter and shield, with lightest options - fat roll.
* Hunter and rifle, with one pistol and 12 bullet - light roll. 24 bullets, fat roll.
* Shield with and rifle combination - medium or fat roll.
