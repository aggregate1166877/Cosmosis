Player combat
=============

Combat is souls like. Loadouts can be combined, and determine roll types. Loadouts are as follows:
* Hunter (bloodborne like, has rally)
* Hollow (souls like, has shields)
* Military engineer (fps like, has guns and limited ammo)

Choosing only one loadout will give you light rolling, subject to these conditions:
* Hollow shields and armour contribute to weight, and can make you medium or fat roll.
* Rifle ammo contribute to weight, and can make you medium or fat roll.

Hunter gear never contributes to roll weight in and of itself. Combining it with other loadout options will.

Some combination examples:
* Hunter only - light roll.
* Shield only, with light shield and armour - light roll.
* Guns only, with 50% ammo capacity - light roll.
* Hunter and shield, with lightest options - fat roll.
* Hunter and rifle, with one pistol and 12 bullet - light roll. 24 bullets, fat roll.
* Shield with and rifle combination - medium or fat roll.

Misc ramblings and ideas
========================

Basic premise:
* Hunters describe themselves as strengthened by the blood.
* Hollows describe themselves as cursed by the flame.
* Military Engineers desperately deny the visions they have of their many
previous lives. This very denial locks away their abilities and make them
regular humans for the most part.

All three cases are manifested blessings from the Cosmos. Hunters are pure, and
see only its benefits. Hollows experience its worst horrors along with its raw
strength. Engineers experience its effects only through reincarnation. The
exception to this is speciality evolution.

Items and misc mechanics
========================

Hunters and hollows are third person. Engineers are first person. The preferred
ship view can be changed, but is first person by default.

Hunters have no equipment weight limits. Hollows have mild limits, engineers
have terrible limits.

Only hollows can properly wield shields. Hunters and engineers lose huge
amounts of stamina.

Only engineers can correctly place traps, automated weapons and automation
mechanisms, correctly wear ghillie suits, perform one-shot execution moves,
etc. Hunters and hollows have a 20% success rate and can spec into it up to
80%, after which it soft caps. Engineers receive 500% additional damage from
the other classes.

Only hunters can [successfully] drink zero-point elixirs. Hollows start glowing
bright blue and may lose HP, whereas engineers start coughing profusely.

Death advances time randomly by different amounts when players die.
* Hunters: usually seconds, rarely minutes, very rarely hours.
* Hollows: 24 hours to 6 months.
* Engineer: 25 to 200 years.
Note that time in this universe is convoluted, and 2 allies may for example
meet again after what may be 1 day for one and 5 years for another.

Only hunters and hollows awaken in The Dream after death (hollows awaken in The
Fortress, right outside the dream). Engineers die permanently. Instead, they're
"reborn" as a new more experienced operative that finds themselves with broken
memories and flashbacks from the previous operative, i.e. they're reincarnated
ad infinitum with the same undying discontented soul.

Hunters and hollows are immortal. Engineers inevitably die of old age and are
replaced through the standard death reincarnation process. There are missions
to end their respective purposes and release their souls, but they're
inevitably reborn. These can be thought of as speciality evolutions.
Speciality changes can be de/activated only at major checkpoints (i.e. tedious
to change), and cannot be done in the middle of missions. The process also
immediately kills the player.
* Hunter: allows transforming into an infant Great One (glass cannon
spellcaster slug thing).
* Hollow: manifests as being reborn an ashen one, which allows exchanging poise
and parry ability for hyper armour stances.
* Engineer: allows transforming into a werewolf. Werewolves have iframes unlike
their human forms.

Engineers have no iframes, and cannot spec into them. This changes if they
perform a speciality change into werewolf state, which sacrifices all
engineering abilities until transforming back.
