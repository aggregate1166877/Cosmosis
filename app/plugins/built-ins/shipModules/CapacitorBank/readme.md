Low total capacity, but high discharge rate. Useful if sandwiched between a
power source and a high-energy system (eg. generator -> sc-bank -> energy 
weapon) as it allows for setups where you house more units than you technically
have the energy output for. For example, if your weapon requires 10x the amount
of energy that your generator can provide, then a capacitor bank allows for
intermittent usage whereas a setup without one would just overload the system
and offer highly reduced weapons output.

All capacitor banks come with protections that disallow linked components from
draining excess power from the rest of the system.
