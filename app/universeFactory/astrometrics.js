 * Some performance tests for potential optimisation: I removed all sqrt
 * functions and switched to squared units to test performance, because square
 * root functions are known to be slow. The distances of 2 million stars were
 * calculated, 10 runs were performed. I only got a 3% speed increase with
 * squared units. Given that the slower sqrt method takes a mere 68
 * milliseconds on average for all 2 million distance calculations on my
 * machine, I think standard units in favour of 3% slower process time is
 * acceptable for current use (recalculations are infrequent, and in a worker).
