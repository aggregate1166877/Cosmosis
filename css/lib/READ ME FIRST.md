### These are not official Semantic UI files

*Please do not replace these files with those from official sources* - they
have been modified from the originals.

Changes from the official sources:

* All `!important` statements have been removed.
* All `cursor` definitions have been removed.

Within Cosmosis, the purpose of Semantic UI is not to serve as a comprehensive
solution, as it might for projects like websites. Instead, Semantic UI acts as
a scaffolding template to build upon. Unlike websites, we actually don't aim
for consistency - major menus have unique styles, in-game computers interfaces
look different based on their operating systems, and so forth. Additionally,
modders are encouraged to add custom styles to their own custom-made menus. For
these reasons, we have reduced some of Semantic UI's CSS specificity to
facilitate easier and faster modding.
