ammo.wasm.js incorrectly assumes that any node-based process has `__dirname`
and other node features defined. This is a terrible assumption and causes
crashes under certain conditions.

This directory contains a copy-paste `from node_modules/three/examples/js/libs/ammo*`.
All instances of `typeof process` is replaced with `typeof false`.
This is a highly unfortunate work-around and needs to be addressed properly.
