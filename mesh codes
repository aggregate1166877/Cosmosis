Introduction
============

Mesh codes are used to tell the engine how individual nodes are to be treated
by the engine. This allows everything from dynamic ship functions (doors,
lights) to defining how destructable things work - all without adding any code
to the game for that mesh. Simply copy-paste of the mesh file and you're done.

Note that the above assumes we're using something GLTF compatible, and has not
yet been tested with other file formats.

Please use prefix_fullMeshName when naming nodes in your mesh. Example:
e5_rearLoadingBay

Nomenclature
============
Interactable node: nodes that the player can interact with by pressing the use key.
Material codes: used for dynamic lighting and cosmetic changes.
Collision node: a shape that is used for collision detection. For example, shooting someone's weapon might damage or disable it.

Interactable node codes
=======================
c1_     Captain's seat. Interactable. Please it where the player's head goes.
c2[-9]_ Bridge seat. 8 total. Interactable.
cx_     Seat the player can sit in. Interactable.
cc_     Outside camera. If there's more than 1, they're cycled alphabetically.

d0_     Hide from scene when the ship is destroyed.
d1_     Partial destructable - scatter mesh upon ship destruction, but leave it in one peace.
d2_     Fully destructable - break the mesh into smaller pieces when the ship is destroyed.

e1_     [Entrance] Door - door that slides left 98% (no animation baked into mesh).
e2_     [Entrance] Door - door that slides right 98% (no animation baked into mesh).
e3_     [Entrance] Door - door that slides up 98% (no animation baked into mesh).
e4_     [Entrance] Door - door that slides down 98% (no animation baked into mesh).
e5_     [Entrance] Door - uses mesh animation.

s1_nn   Switch that opens/closes a door, where nn is the door name. Example: s1_e5_loadingBay will open a door named e5_loadingBay. Note: 'door' here is only used for demonstration purposes. You can use a switch with any interactible mesh. If it's not a door, then instead of opening/closing, it will activate/deactivate the mesh.
s2_nn   Like s1_nn, but only opens the door.
s3_nn   Like s1_nn, but only closes the door.

w1_     Window (dynamic), can accumulate grime.
w2_     Window, dirty.
w3_     Window, absolutely filthy.
w4_     Window, cannot get dirty (useful for indoor areas).
w5_     Secure window - like w1, but is destructable. If the windows breaks while the ship has power, a shield will form to protect the cabin and keep air in.
w6_     Dangerous window - like w1, but is destructable. Breaking it causes cabin depressurisation.

z1_     Manual ship self-destruct button.
z2_     Like z1, but if more than one z2 exists, then all of them need to be activate for destruction to take place.
z3_     Emergency power shutdown.
z4_     Like z3, but if more than one z4 exists, then all of them need to be activate for shutdown to take place.
z5_     Manually cycles system emergency light modes.
z6_     Turn off life support in this section. This will cause the atmosphere to gradually become hypoxic.
z7_     Turn off life support for the entire ship.
x8_     Depressurise this section. May cause full ship depressurisation on smaller ships.
x9_     Like x8, but multi switch.
x1_     Shut down life support.
x2_     Like x1, but multiple required.
x3_     Eject ship warp core.
x4_     Like x3, but multiple required.
xa_     Maintenance hatch - provides basic ship computer interface.
xb_     Maintenance hatch - provides advanced ship computer interface.


Material codes
==============
l1_     Passive light - these are like LED strips all over the ship. Generally white (normal) or red (warning) or flashing red (critical).
l2_     Beacons (a.k.a strobe lights / anti-collision lights) - like the blinking lights you find outside aeroplanes.


Physics collision node codes
============================
ph_moduleName_  Weapon collision. Damages the module named moduleName.
pw_             Pilot windshield.
ph_             Generic part of the hull.
pf_             Hull area close to hyperspace drive. Can be used for indirect damage.
pd_             External blast door. Damage can make door get stuck when opening.
pe_             Area near engine. Can be used for indirect damage.
pp_             Area near core electrical systems. Can be used for indirect damage.
